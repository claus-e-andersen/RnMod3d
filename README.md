RnMod3d
=======

Finite-volume radon transport model (porous media)

This numerical model is written in the programming language Pascal and it was originally designed for
the compilers Turbo Pascal 7.0 or Delphi. However, the code runs withoutout problems (and modifications) with Free Pascal. 

To run it with Free Pascal I have tried the folowing on a Linux machine (openSUSE 13.1 running Free Pascal vers. 2.6.4 and the Lazarus IDE version 1.2.4). (1) Put the RNMOD3D files in a single folder. (2) Open Lazarus. (3) Go to Tools / Convert Delphi project to Lazarus project and select one of the .pdr-files (e.g. F0100prg.dpr). Lazarus will then automatically make a Lazarus .lpr-file. (4) From the Run menu item select Compile/build/run. To see the output, open the terminal window using: View / Debug windows / Terminal output.

It's really easy.
